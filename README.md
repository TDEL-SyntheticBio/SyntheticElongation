# SyntheticElongation
CC3D Simulation Files for Synthetic Elongation Project @ Morsut Lab (Curated by Christian Chung)

The files provided in this repository provide the coding files sed to produce the simulations seen in Courte et al., 2024. 

The following files are provided in this repository: 

1) Unparameterized Elongation Model - An unparameterized version of our synthetic elongation system, showcasing ideal elongation based on arbitrary values implemented into CompuCell3D. (Only the base file is provided for space purposes, the metrics altered for the parameter screen can be seen in the Supplementary Excel file showcasing the genomes). 
2) Phase Separation Models - Models highlighting changes in adhesion metrics that contribute to our system's phase separation between grey and red cells (attests to the signaling speed control).
3) Proliferation and Viscocapillary Speed Models - Models testing various _in silico_ proliferation metrics to parameterize their _in vitro_ equivalences. (Only the base file is provided for space purposes, the metrics altered can be seen in the Supplementary Excel file showcasing the genomes).
4) Bounded Morphospace Models - Models demonstrating changes in proliferation control, phase separation, and viscocapillary speed utilized for the morphospace.
5) _in silico_ Recapitulations of Current Elongation Models - _in silico_ Recapitulation of _in vitro_ datasets placed in the morphospace.
